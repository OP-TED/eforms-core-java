# eForms Core Library 1.3.0 Release Notes

The eForms Core Library is a collection of utilities that are used by our sample applications as well as the EFX Toolkit for Java Developers.

## In this release

This release improves XPathProcessor contextualisation by fixing an issue that caused unnecessary back-steps to be inserted in the contextualised output when both XPaths contain predicates.

## Download

You can download the latest eForms Core library from Maven Central.
